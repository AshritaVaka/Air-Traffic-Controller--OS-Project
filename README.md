# Air-Traffic-Controller--OS-Project
This was a group project under Professor Barsha Mitra in the course Operating Systems CS F372

## What is it about 
Developed an Air Traffic Control System using key OS concepts. Simulated planes as single-threaded
processes, categorized into passenger and cargo types. Implemented airports as multi-threaded processes
for fight management, and managed the Air Traffic Controller (ATC) as a single-threaded process. Created
passenger processes as children of their respective planes. Ensured system integrity with a dedicated
cleanup process. Demonstrated proficiency in process management, multi-threading, and system resource
allocation in a simulated environment.
